A collection of minor snippets I've written that may be useful.

Currently contains:
- burnAtom -- power virus to maximize power on an Atom core.
- perf_harness -- pintools that inject performance counter measurements in a binary.
               -- including a light front-end to perfmon2 for easy counter management.
